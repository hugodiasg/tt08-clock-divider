## How it works

This design is a clock divider. It receives a byte at its input (scale {ui_in[7:0]}), calculates true_scale = scale*CONST (CONST = 392160) and the clock frequency at the input is divided (clk_out {uo_out[0]} = clk_in {clk} / true_scale). If the scale is set to 0, the clk_in is just repeated at the clk_out. With scale = 1111_1111, it is possible to achieve true_scale â‰ˆ 66e6.

## How to test

- Scale = choose a byte
- Connect clk_in to a clock signal
- Do the nrst to reset
- Observe the clock signal with the frequency divided into clk_out

## External hardware

Signal generator to generate `clk_in` and a oscilloscope to see the `clk_out`. And switches or some microcontroler to set `scale[7:0]`.
